<h1>Welcome to Maze Maker!</h1>

Of all the useless projects I've created, this one tops the list on complexity. I'd been leetcoding for a while and learning about graph theory. One day I woke up feeling algorithmiky, so I came up with this. <br/><br/>
The stack used includes HTML/CSS/JS and React. All logic was coded in JS, which was more difficult than I anticipated having done all my leetcode/algo practice on C++. I guess there's a reason they dont use loosely-typed languages for algorithms and data processing. <br/>
I wish I could say all the algorithms utilized were a personal creation, but I can't take credit where none is due. I gained inspiration from the brilliant Jamies Buck, who so gratuitiously blogged about maze generation using myriad algorithms. His implementations were on Ruby and use a notation to this day I cannot decipher. However, the pseudo-code and explanations provided where more than enough to get the idea running on Javascript. <br/><br/>
